# EVENT MANAGER
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
	This application is a simple event manager that allows you to add events to a calendar, receive notifications for those events at different times and allows you to save some data from an event so that you can add it more easily and quickly to your calendar in the future.

	Launching the application brings up MainActivity, which presents the user with a CalendarView and a FloatingActionButton, as well as initializing the database for Events. One design decision I made early on was to use separate databases for Events and EventTemplates to use in the separate activities for Events and Templates, however later in the development process I decided it was redundant and used more memory than necessary, so I decided to consolidate to one table. I created a column for whether the saved event was to be used as a template and a method in the DAO to just get all Events where that boolean was marked as true in the database. Clicking on a day on the CalendarView launches EventListActivity, clicking on the FloatingActionButton saves the selected date from the Calendar and passes it to the Intent that launches the NewEventActivity.
	
	The NewEventActivity creates a screen where a user can enter information about the Event they would like to add. There are EditTexts for the Title and Location, and a Button and TextView each for Date, Start Time and End Time. Pressing the buttons will launch a DatePicker or TimePicker where the user can select the date, start and end times, and then takes that data and formats it correctly and sets the text in the TextViews to display their selection. The Button for the Alert Type launches a popup menu with a number of selections, and on pressing an option the onMenuOptionClick will run assigning their selection to the alertType variable. There is a toggle to set the boolean for whether the event is saved as a template, and a Button to launch the LoadFromTemplatesActivity, and a button to save the event. Pressing the Save to Calendar button will check to ensure none of the fields are left blank and simply raise an error if that is the case. If all the fields are valid it will save the event to the database, schedule a notification for the event based off of the user's selection for Alert Type, and finish the current activity.
	
	If the user launches the LoadFromTemplatesActivity, a similar screen launches but instead of displaying all a day's events, it will display all the events that are marked as templates. On clicking a template in this activity will send that event's data back to the NewEventActivity or AddEventToDayActivity, whichever it was launched from, and those activities will load that data into the corresponding EditTexts/TextViews/Variables when the LoadFromTempaltesActivity finishes and returns a RESULT_OK.
	
	The Event class defines the attributes that an Event has for entry in the database. There are Strings for Title, Location, Date, Start Time, End Time, and Alert Type, and a boolean for whether the event is marked as a template. The EventDao class creates the database methods that the application will use to insert events into the database, as well as methods for getting all the events that occur on a specific day and all the events that are marked as templates. The EventDatabase class creates the links the database to the Dao.
	
	EventListActivity is launched from MainActivity, and is a RecyclerView of all the events from the database that occur on the selected date from the CalendarView, with a FloatingActionButton to launch the AddEventToDay activity. It creates an ItemTouchHelper and attaches it to the recyclerView so that a user can swipe an Event to delete it and update the lsit. The EventListAdapter class loads the Events from the database where the Date column matches the selected date gotten from the Intent, creates & binds the viewholder for each recyclerView item.
	
	If the FloatingActionButton in the EventListActivity is pressed it brings up the AddEventToDay activity, which extends the NewEventActivity, uses the same layout and many of the same methods. The only real difference is that the AddEventToDayActivity is passed the user's selected date and preloads it into the TextView, and does not allow it to be edited.
	
	The final two classes in the application are the NotificationChannelBuilder, which creates a notification channel for events and is loaded by the application on startup, as well as the NotificationPublisher is given an intent to publish a notification to the system when the notifications are scheduled.
